Hey, I'm Rick.

I've spent my entire career building digital media and software products.

Most of all, I enjoy helping people be more effective at work with better products, technology, and processes.

When not working, I watch a lot of NBA, snowboard, golf, and play with my dog.

I'm also a bit of a content junkie, and think a lot about how business, policy, and societal trends actually impact people.
