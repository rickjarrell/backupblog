Hey, I'm Rick.

I'm a product manager, content junkie, and dog lover. I've worked in digital media and enterprise software and have an MBA from UW-Madison.

When not working, I watch a lot of NBA, snowboard, and golf.

I stay curious and like to explore a variety of subjects. Right now, I'm interested in:

- How business trends impact society, both good and bad
- Technologyâ€™s impact on the frontline workforce
- Decaying digital media and publishing industry
- Regulation and deregulation of business
- Consumer finance through the lens of personal finance

Writing helps formulate my thoughts. I do that here and in my [newsletter](www.rickjarrell.com/newsletter).

I'm confident in my pontifications, but these are just my opinions. This is a learning exercise. I'm happy to be proven wrong.
