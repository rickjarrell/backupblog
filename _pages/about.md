Hey, I'm Rick.

I do product development, program management, and subscriber growth.

I'm not internet popular, so you're probably here because you know me. But just in case, here's an overview.

I've done this at Online Media and B2B SaaS companies ranging from 10-1000 people with $1M to $200M annual revenue serving customers in Transportation, Hospitality, Healthcare, Finance, and Retail.

When not working, I watch a lot of NBA, snowboard, golf, and play with my dog.
