Hey, I'm Rick.

Iâ€™m a product manager with experience in enterprise software and digital media. Once upon a time I got a degree in Finance, as well as an MBA.

I watch a lot of basketball and have an affinity for dogs.

I write an occasional newsletter with musings on business, money, and work trends that I find interesting. Sign up at [rickjarrell.substack.com](http://rickjarrell.substack.com).
